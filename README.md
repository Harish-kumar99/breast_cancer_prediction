# breast_cancer_prediction
in this project i used three different machine learning algorithms on breast cancer dataset

A cancer that develops in the breast cells and progresses in stages. Few early symptoms may include new lump in the underarm or in breast, itching or discharge from the nipples, and skin texture change of the nipple or breast

There have been several empirical studies addressing breast cancer using machine learning and soft computing techniques. Many claim that their algorithms are faster, easier, or more accurate than others are.
